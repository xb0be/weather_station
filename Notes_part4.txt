1. Timings
Define highs and lows that represent "0" and "1".
a) DATA
DATA_HIGH = 24 samples at 48kHZ => 24/48000 = 500 us
DATA_LOW_0 = 96 samples at 48kHZ = 2.000 us
DATA_LOW_1 = 190 samples at 48kHZ = 4.000 us

=> DATA_HIGH + DATA_LOW_0 represents "0"
=> DATA_HIGH + DATA_LOW_1 represents "1"
=> send appropriate signal burst, defined by data string
(note: 1 sample at 48kHZ means app. 20 us)

b) SYNC:
SYNC is sent at the beginning.
SYNC_HIGH = DATA_HIGH
SYNC_TIME = 426 samples at 48kHZ = 9.000 us
=> send HIGH for (DATA_HIGH time) + LOW for (SYNC_TIME time)

c) WAIT
How much time we have to wait between each signal packet (there are 8 of them).
WAIT_LOW = SYNC_LOW


2. Algorithm
We have to send complete signal like this:

send SYNC
for i = 1 to 8:
    send DATA burst (with checksum at the end)
    send WAIT between each burst
end_for

3. Arduino code
String to reproduce:
111001010000001110100000001000011000

This should be recognized by rtl_4333. So let's fire up rtl_433 and press the button on Arduino.
$ rtl_433 -D -A -R 16
